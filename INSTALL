LifeLines Source Release, Version 3.0.6
http://lifelines.sourceforge.net
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the source distribution of the LifeLines system, a genealogy
software system.  To build and install LifeLines, execute the 
following commands:

	./configure (if that does't work, try 'sh ./configure')
	make
        make install

This will generate Makefiles suitable for your platform and then build
and install the LifeLines programs.  You will end up with two 
executables (installed in various places, depending on your platform):

llines  -- main LifeLines system program
btedit -- general purpose btree edit program

Don't use btedit unless you know exactly what it does.  It is a superuser
administration tool for unmangling mangled databases -- powerful, but
deadly.  It is rarely, if ever, needed.
