LifeLines Source Release, Version 3.0.7
http://lifelines.sourceforge.net
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the source distribution of the LifeLines system, a genealogy
software system.

LifeLines should compile correctly using GNU gcc or any native C compiler.
It also will build using the Cygnus tools on Windows.

To build and install LifeLines, do the following:

	./configure (if that does't work, try 'sh ./configure')
	make
	make install

This will generate Makefiles suitable for your platform and then build
and install the LifeLines programs.  You will end up with the following
executables (installed in various places, depending on your platform):

llines   -- main LifeLines system program
btedit   -- general purpose btree edit program
dbverify -- checks a LifeLines database for problems

llines is the main LifeLines program.

dverify can be used to verify the correctness of a LifeLines database.
This is handy if you're storing databases on floppies, or just for
peace of mind.

btedit is a administration tool used for unmangling mangled databases, 
and is extremely powerful.  You should only use this program under the
expert guidance of a LifeLines developer.
