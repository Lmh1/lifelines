LifeLines Source Release, Version 3.0.7
http://lifelines.sourceforge.net
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

*****************
UNIX installation
*****************


This is the source distribution of the LifeLines system, a genealogy
software system.

LifeLines should compile correctly using GNU gcc or any native C compiler.
It also will build using the Cygnus tools on Windows (but see note in the
platform notes section below).

To build and install LifeLines, do the following:

	./configure (if that does't work, try 'sh ./configure')
	make
	make install

This will generate Makefiles suitable for your platform and then build
and install the LifeLines programs.  You will end up with the following
executables (installed in various places, depending on your platform):

llines   -- main LifeLines system program
btedit   -- general purpose btree edit program
dbverify -- checks a LifeLines database for problems

llines is the main LifeLines program.

dverify can be used to verify the correctness of a LifeLines database.
This is handy if you're storing databases on floppies, or just for
peace of mind.

btedit is a administration tool used for unmangling mangled databases, 
and is extremely powerful.  You should only use this program under the
expert guidance of a LifeLines developer.


***********************
MS-Windows installation
***********************


For installing the binary distribution on MS-Windows, refer to the
file Install.LifeLines.Windows.txt included in that distribution
(& also included in the docs subdirectory of the source
distributions).

For compiling from source on MS-Windows, if using cygwin, refer to
the UNIX notes above. If using MS Visual C++, you may use the
project files included in the subdirectories beneath /win32/msvc6
(these are in fact used to generate the binaries in the MS-Windows
binary distribution).


***********************
Platform specific notes
***********************


* Cygwin

Cygwin is a UNIX environment for MS-Windows. 
(http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin)
The lines around the boxes in the lifelines curses GUI use OEM
box characters, and so only display correctly with this setting:
    export CYGWIN=codepage:oem


* gcc 2.7.2.1

gcc 2.7.2.1 does not understand -Wreturn-type, so this
must be removed from configure and from CFLAGS in
interp/Makefile* files. This must be done before configuring,
because it causes configure tests to fail spuriously.


* curses

Compiling with curses (lacking ncurses) on a BSDI 3.1 box,
I had to add
   -ltermcap
to the LIBS line in liflines/Makefile. (The symptom was
"unknown symbol... _tputs.)
