LifeLines 3.0.4 Released under Open Source License
==================================================

LifeLines Version 3.0.4, December 15, 1999, is now released under an
MIT-style license.  See the file LICENSE in included with this kit for
the full license.

The previous supported version was LifeLines Version 3.0.2.  There was
an unofficial LifeLines Version V3.0.3 floating around so the this
version was incremented to 3.0.4 to reduce any confusion.  Hopefully
any useful modifications will be folded back in.
