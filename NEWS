-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes in 3.0.6.1-dev
==================

- traverse could crash due to index and/or buffer falling out of cache

- bugfixes in child_indiseq & difference_indiseq.

- _substring & llindex subject to buffer overflow

- Import not closing file handle. striplead could read before
  beginning of buffer.

- upper or lower could overflow internal buffers

- NULL PSTRINGs (eg, from getindi(), or father()) could crash string
  functions

- fornodes wasn't handling nodes with no children correctly

- was double-deleting strings for filenames named in include statements

- added readonly message when adding/editing S/E/X records
   (instead of ASSERT coredump)

- generic_to_list_string didn't handle NULL keys because of bug

- menuchoose would crash if non-string list item

- Was not saving changes to value of top-level node when editing
  (eg, text directly in the NOTE line of an 'other' NOTE)

- Removed most pvalue leaks in running program(s)

- (Windows) Notepad was appending .txt to temp file, preventing creation
  of new trans tables or user options tables 

- (Windows) Editing user options or trans tables could crash because
  of CR/LF translation causing fread to not report filesize number of bytes

- Deep recursive search with children (or similar) could flush cache & crash
  (Now it will report cache overflow & fail, instead of failing unpredictably
  with no explanation)
