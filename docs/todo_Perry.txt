Upgrade prog_error to prog_var_error in various places

gettags & fortags stuff on RFE


*** OLDER STUFF ***

Decide how to proceed, now that I've implemented rbtree as an alternate implemenation of table.

Alter FORLIST macros to use list iterators.

Get rid of NEW types of PVALUEs (make them all PNULL).

Split gedcom.h declarations by module.

Can browse S/E/X be changed to use the full-screen list browse ?

How about a new browse anything off of main menu ?

Do something about list menu (the detail cmds are not listed) -- use the fancy menuitem stuff ?

Implement check for overwrite in file save ?

Send report output thru msg list (have to parse for carriage returns).

Test ~ on different Windows OS's.

Rewrite text files in docs subdir to cover different Windows OS's.

Make msgbox multiline gracefully.

Have created db layer & Berkeley backend, but need to fix traversal to use iteration, and need to integrate into cvs trunk.

Add access to import errors and maybe other logs via editor.

W. E. Brown's enhancement requests of 2005-10

Fix the path.c code for network shares (ugh). What about calling OpenFileDialog on MS-Windows ?

It would be nice to have a way to jump to first surname beginning with, eg, S, in the list (like MS-Windows list controls).

Consider pulling in regex and/or pcre if available, and making available to report language. But then what do we do ? Have 3 arguments to create_match_string ? (pcre style, regex style, and fpattern style ?)

GUI: Someone did a wxwindows frontend in 2005 spring

*** REPORT LANGUAGE ISSUES ************

Implement setproperty in report language.

Consider adding firstrec,nextrec,forrec to enumerate other types of records (obviously SOUR & EVEN have to be implemented differently).

Do something about unused ARRAY type (would be better to implement existing LIST type as arrays, like STL dequeues).

Disable report debugger in llexec.

Make 6th argument to extractdatestr mandatory.

Is there a bug in __extractnames - it deletes its value before manipulating the string; what if the list was from a temp?

*** CHARACTER ISSUES ************

Implement character classification routines.

Add textdomain & gettext & ngettext to report language.

Decide whether to move strings from messages.c back to sources. The real question is how will i18n work when there is a GUI version and it shares many source files..

i18n strings in valdlgcom.c & in node.c.

Remove Finnish specific code.

Does customized SOUNDEX work ? document (or fix)
