Running LifeLines for Windows

(This presumes you have installed it, per the
Install.LifeLines.Windows.txt document)

1)
Double-click on the shortcut on your desktop
for LifeLines.
A DOS window should open, with the title bar
giving the LifeLines version, and with a prompt
in the middle of the screen, asking
What directory holds the LifeLines database ?
enter path:

2)
Enter a name for your first LifeLines database.
It must be a valid Windows directory name
(no slashes, no colon, no quotation marks...).
LifeLines will then create & open this brand new
empty database for you.

3)
At this point, your best course of action is to
connect to the Internet, browse to the LifeLines
home page, and begin reading the LifeLines 3.0.2
User's Manual, which explains how to proceed,
adding data and so forth. (I do not know of a 
newer version of the User's Manual at this time - 
of course, if one is available, by all means 
browse to it!)

(You are at the Main Menu section now, but you
would be well-advised to read the previous
Introduction to GEDCOM section as well.)
