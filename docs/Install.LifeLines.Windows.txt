LifeLines installation for Windows
  Edited: 2001/12/30 by Perry Rapp

1)
Choose & create your directories, eg:
\Program Files\LifeLines (for the program)
\My Documents\LifeLines\Archives (for ged files)
\My Documents\LifeLines\Databases (for databases)
\My Documents\LifeLines\Programs (for report programs)
\My Documents\LifeLines\Outputs (for report outputs)
\My Documents\LifeLines\ttref (for translation tables)

2)
Place the LifeLines program (Lines.exe) & 
 configuration file (lines.cfg) into the
 program directory (eg, \Program Files\LifeLines)

3)
*If* you are on MS-Windows U.S. English edition,
and if you plan to use an MS-Windows editor such as notepad,
then download the translation tables for US English Windows,
and install the four *.tt files into
\My Documents\LifeLines\ttref

(This step may be omitted if you only plan to use ascii data,
but you should come back & do this before you start dealing
with non-ascii data.)

4)
Edit the configuration file (lines.cfg) to reflect your
 directory choices from step (1)

5)
In a windows explorer window (eg, right-click on 
 My Computer and choose Explore), browse to your program
 directory of step (2) (eg, \Program Files\Lines),
 right-click on the executable (Lines.exe) and choose
 Copy, then move your cursor to a clear area on your
 desktop (the background where My Computer sits), and
 right-click and choose Paste Shortcut. This is your
 desktop shortcut to run the program.

6)
Right-click on the new shortcut icon on your desktop,
and choose Rename. Adjust the name as you like
(eg, to LifeLines).

Now you are ready to run LifeLines. 
Refer to the Run.LifeLines.Windows.txt document.
