LifeLines installation for Windows
  Edited: 2002/06/18 by Perry Rapp

1)
Choose & create your directories, eg:
\Program Files\LifeLines (for the program)
\My Documents\LifeLines\Archives (for ged files)
\My Documents\LifeLines\Databases (for databases)
\My Documents\LifeLines\Programs (for report programs)
\My Documents\LifeLines\Outputs (for report outputs)
\My Documents\LifeLines\ttref (for translation tables)

2)
Place the LifeLines program (Lines.exe) & 
 configuration file (lines.cfg) into the
 program directory (eg, \Program Files\LifeLines)

3)
Unzip the translation files under the program directory
(eg, you get \Program Files\LifeLines\sv\LC_MESSAGES\lifelines.mo)

4a)
Edit lines.cfg and adjust your codepages as appropriate
(Edit the entries GuiCodeset, EditorCodeset, ReportCodeset, and GedcomCodset)

4b)
Enable the UTF-8 setting in your lines.cfg
(Edit the entry NewDbProps)

5)
Optionally install any translation tables (eg, to allow you to enter
letters that your editor will not create). Translation tables are still
undergoing development, and more instructions will be added later.

6)
Edit the configuration file (lines.cfg) to reflect your
 directory choices from step (1)

7)
In a windows explorer window (eg, right-click on 
 My Computer and choose Explore), browse to your program
 directory of step (2) (eg, \Program Files\LifeLines),
 right-click on the executable (Lines.exe) and choose
 Copy, then move your cursor to a clear area on your
 desktop (the background where My Computer sits), and
 right-click and choose Paste Shortcut. This is your
 desktop shortcut to run the program.

8)
Right-click on the new shortcut icon on your desktop,
and choose Rename. Adjust the name as you like
(eg, to LifeLines).

Now you are ready to run LifeLines. 
Refer to the Run.LifeLines.Windows.txt document.
