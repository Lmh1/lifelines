LifeLines installation for Windows
  Edited: 2002/05/01 by Perry Rapp

1)
Choose & create your directories, eg:
\Program Files\LifeLines (for the program)
\My Documents\LifeLines\Archives (for ged files)
\My Documents\LifeLines\Databases (for databases)
\My Documents\LifeLines\Programs (for report programs)
\My Documents\LifeLines\Outputs (for report outputs)
\My Documents\LifeLines\ttref (for translation tables)

2)
Place the LifeLines program (Lines.exe) & 
 configuration file (lines.cfg) into the
 program directory (eg, \Program Files\LifeLines)

3a)
If you are on MS-Windows, check the web page to see
if there is an appropriate zip of translation tables
for your system codepages.

If so, download & install the *.tt files into
\My Documents\LifeLines\ttref

Note that if you plan to use a UTF-8 editor (and notepad
under MS-Windows 2000 will function as a UTF-8 editor),
you do not need four translation tables, but only two --
just the two for translating display & input (in the
console mode window).

(This step may be omitted if you only plan to use ascii data,
but you should come back & do this before you start dealing
with non-ascii data.)

3b)
Unzip the translations into subdirectories beneath the directory of
step (2) (eg, \Program Files\LifeLines), so that you will wind up with,
eg, \Program Files\LifeLines\sv\LC_MESSAGES\lifelines.mo
for the Swedish translation message catalog.
This will be used if (1) you have an environment variable set,
or (2) you set an option in the configuration file like so:
UiLocale=sv

4)
Edit the configuration file (lines.cfg) to reflect your
 directory choices from step (1)

5)
In a windows explorer window (eg, right-click on 
 My Computer and choose Explore), browse to your program
 directory of step (2) (eg, \Program Files\LifeLines),
 right-click on the executable (Lines.exe) and choose
 Copy, then move your cursor to a clear area on your
 desktop (the background where My Computer sits), and
 right-click and choose Paste Shortcut. This is your
 desktop shortcut to run the program.

6)
Right-click on the new shortcut icon on your desktop,
and choose Rename. Adjust the name as you like
(eg, to LifeLines).

Now you are ready to run LifeLines. 
Refer to the Run.LifeLines.Windows.txt document.
