     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN

     that runs on <ACRONYM
CLASS="acronym"
>UNIX</ACRONYM
> systems. It maintains
     genealogical records (persons, families, sources, events and
     others) in a database, and generates reports from those
     records. There are no practical limits on the number of
     records that can be stored in a
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> database, nor on the
     amounts or kinds of data that can be kept in the
     records. <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> does not contain
     built-in reports.  Instead it provides a programming subsystem
     that you use to program your own reports and charts. The
     programming subsystem also lets you query your databases and
     process your data in any
     way. <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> uses the terminal
     independent features of <ACRONYM

     screen and menu based user interface.

>&#13;the <CODE

programs.
</P
><P
>&#13;
     The <CODE
CLASS="option"
>-r</CODE
> option opens the database with read-only
     access. When in this mode
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> will not let you modify
     the database; no other operations are affected. The
     <CODE
CLASS="option"
>-w</CODE
> option opens the database with writeable
     access. If the database cannot be opened with the requested
     mode <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> quits
     immediately. When you open a database with neither the
     <CODE
CLASS="option"
>-r</CODE
> or <CODE
CLASS="option"
>-w</CODE
> options,
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> first tries to open the
     database with writeable access; if not possible
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> then tries to open the
     database with read-only access; and if this is not possible
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> quits. A
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> database may be open
     simultaneously by any number of programs with read-only
     access; however, if a database is open by a program with
     writeable access, then it cannot be opened by any other other
     program.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     In rare situations the read/write mode mechanism can fail;
     when this happens a database may appear unopenable. If this
     happens use the <CODE
CLASS="option"
>-f</CODE
> option to force open the
     database; this will open the database and reset the mode
     mechanism. This is a dangerous feature; you can use it to open
     the same database with writeable access more than once; the
     results are unpredictable and generally disastrous.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     The multiuser protection supplied by this reader/writer access
     mechanism is provided via a flag setting in the database, so both
     read-only and writeable access actually alter the database (read-only
     access only alters the value of this flag). For truly read-only
     access, e.g., for use with read-only media, the best solution is to
     lock (-ly) the      database before copying it to the read-only media. This
     annotates the database itself as being for immutable access.
     Alternatively, to use a database already on read-only media and not
     so annotated, use the immutable (-i) flag.

</P
><P
>&#13;By default lifelines supports a traditional family concept, that is, each
family has at most one father and one mother.  The -n flag relaxes this
restriction.  However, not all the code in lifelines supports these
relaxations.  For example, the default family browse screen will only display
two parents, however by switching to one of the gedcom modes of displaying the
family you can see all the data.
</P
><P
>&#13;
     If you don't give the name of a database on the command line,
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> will prompt you for
     it.  If the name you supply is an absolute pathname or a
     relative pathname it is used as the path to the database.
     If you provided a simple filename and you use the
     <CODE
CLASS="envar"
>LLDATABASES</CODE
> variable or user options (described later),
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> will search for the
     database in the directories named in the variable; this can be
     very convenient.
     If <CODE
CLASS="envar"
>LLDATABASES</CODE
> is not set
     the filename you enter is looked for in the current working directory.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     If you would like to choose a database from a list of existing ones,
     enter a single question mark and press return when
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> prompts you for the database name.
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> will then display a list of all
     databases that it can find, and you may select one from the list.

CLASS="acronym"
>GEDCOM</ACRONYM
> is defined at two levels. At the
     syntactic level <ACRONYM
CLASS="acronym"
>GEDCOM</ACRONYM
> is a simple set of
     rules for organizing and structuring data into records, with
     no concern about the types of records, types or formats of
     information in the records, or the relationships between
     records. At the semantic level <ACRONYM
CLASS="acronym"
>GEDCOM</ACRONYM
> adds
     an additional set of rules that specify what record types are
     allowed, how records must be structured, how data within the
     records must be identified and formatted, and what specific
     relationships between the record types are allowed. In
     principle there can be multiple semantic versions of
     <ACRONYM
CLASS="acronym"
>GEDCOM</ACRONYM
>, though in practice there is only
     one, lineage-linked <ACRONYM
CLASS="acronym"
>GEDCOM</ACRONYM
>. Unfortunately
     this semantic version of <ACRONYM
CLASS="acronym"
>GEDCOM</ACRONYM
> is poorly
     defined, and every genealogical system has interpreted it in
     different ways.

</P

>&#13;
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> uses
     <ACRONYM
CLASS="acronym"
>GEDCOM</ACRONYM
> primarily at the syntactic level,
     though it does impose a few of the generally accepted
     lineage-linked semantic restrictions. This means some
     important things. It means that you can store all your
     genealogical data in your <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
>
     database, and that you have wide freedom in how you choose
     your own conventions for structuring and formatting your
     data. But it also means that the way you store data in your
     databases can be different from the way that someone else
     stores their data.  This can be a problem if you share data
     with others or share report programs with other
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> users. My recommendation
     is to use <ACRONYM
CLASS="acronym"
>GEDCOM</ACRONYM
> lineage-linking
     conventions wherever possible.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> does not use forms or
     screens to guide you through entering or changing
     data. Instead you use a screen editor and directly edit the
     data records. This requires you to understand the
     <ACRONYM
CLASS="acronym"
>GEDCOM</ACRONYM
> format, and be able to edit data in
     <ACRONYM
CLASS="acronym"
>GEDCOM</ACRONYM
> format, before you can use
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
>. The
     <ACRONYM
CLASS="acronym"
>GEDCOM</ACRONYM
> format is quite simple; this
     introduction will provide all you need to know about
     <ACRONYM
CLASS="acronym"
>GEDCOM</ACRONYM

     <SPAN
CLASS="application"

>&#13;
     A <ACRONYM
CLASS="acronym"
>GEDCOM</ACRONYM
> record is made up of lines. Each
     line has a level number and a tag, and most lines have a value
     following the tag. The first line in every record has a
     cross-reference index between the level number and the tag.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     Level numbers allow data to be structured to any degree of
     detail; lines with higher level numbers expand on lines with
     lower numbers. Each record begins at level 0, and each deeper
     level increments the level by
     one. <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> does not restrict
     the structuring depth. Tags are uppercase (by convention) code
     words that specify the kind of information on the line or on
     the higher numbered lines that follow. The information after
     the tag, if any, is the value of the line.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     The first line in a record indicates its type. There are four
     fixed record types in <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
>
     databases: person, family, source and event. The first, 0
     level line in these records have tags
     <CODE
CLASS="structname"
>INDI</CODE
>, <CODE
CLASS="structname"
>FAM</CODE
>,
     <CODE
CLASS="structname"
>SOUR</CODE
> and
     <CODE
CLASS="structname"
>EVEN</CODE
>, respectively. Besides these
     record types, you may create your own record types by using
     any other tag on the 0 level line of a record. The lines that
     begin records are the only level 0 lines used in
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
>. Each level 0 line has a
     cross-reference index between the level number and the
     tag. This index is the record's internal reference key; other
     records may refer to this record by using this index.
     Cross-reference indexes are bracketed by @ characters.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     The first line in the example record has the
     <CODE
CLASS="structname"
>INDI</CODE
> tag, identifying it as a
     person. The cross-reference index value, I25, can be used by
     other records to refer to this record.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     The second line in the example has the person's name. Each
     person record in a <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
>
     database must have at least one <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>1
     NAME</CODE
> line, and its value must be in
     <ACRONYM
CLASS="acronym"
>GEDCOM</ACRONYM
> name format. This format allows
     names to be as long as needed, but the surname, which may be
     placed anywhere in the name, must be separated from the rest
     of the name by one or two slashes. For example:

<DIV
CLASS="example"
><A
NAME="AEN250"
></A
><P
><B
>Example 1-2. 
Example of NAME formats

</B
></P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;1 NAME <KBD

>
1 NAME <KBD
CLASS="userinput"
>John/Smith/Jr.</KBD
>
</PRE
></DIV
>

</P
><P
>&#13;
     The second slash is required only if name elements follow the
     surname. White space is optional before the first slash and
     after the second. If you don't know a person's surname, or the
     person doesn't have a surname, you may use / or // or no
     slashes at all. For example:

<DIV
CLASS="example"

</PRE
></DIV
>

     are all ways to enter a person named Mary with no known
     surname. A person may have any number, including zero, given
     names and/or initials. A <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
>
     person record may have any number of <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>1
     NAME</CODE
> lines, though the person will be displayed
     with the first name value only. Persons are indexed under all
     their names, however, so you will be able to search for
     persons by any of their names.
</P
><P
>&#13;
     The next line in the example gives the person's
     sex. <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> doesn't require a
     <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>1 SEX</CODE
> line, but you should include
     it. The value of the line should be <KBD
CLASS="userinput"
>M</KBD
>
     or <KBD
CLASS="userinput"
>F</KBD
> if the sex is known; it can be
     left blank or set to <KBD
CLASS="userinput"
>U</KBD
> or
     <KBD
CLASS="userinput"
>?</KBD
>, say, if not known. A person must
     have a <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>1 SEX</CODE
> line with a value of
     either <KBD
CLASS="userinput"
>M</KBD
> or <KBD
CLASS="userinput"
>F</KBD
>
     before he or she can be made a spouse or parent in a family.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     The example record also contains three events: birth,
     naturalization, and death. An event begins with a level 1 line
     whose tag indicates the event type. For example,
     <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>BIRT</CODE
> is the tag for a birth event.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     Events usually have at least a <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>2
     DATE</CODE
> and a <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>2 PLAC</CODE
>
     line and often a <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>2 SOUR</CODE
> line. The
     <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>DATE</CODE
> and
     <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>PLAC</CODE
> lines give the date and place
     of the event. The value of a
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
>
     <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>DATE</CODE
> line is free format, though
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> will try to parse it for
     specific day, month and year information. The value of a
     <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>PLAC</CODE
> line is usually a
     comma-separated list of geopolitical units, starting with the
     most specific, ending with the most general. The
     <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>SOUR</CODE
> line indicates the source of
     information about the event. The
     <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>SOUR</CODE
> line can be the root of a full
     description of the source, or the value of the
     <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>SOUR</CODE
> line can be a cross-reference
     key that refers to the source record that describes the
     source.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     The naturalization event (with tag
     <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>NATU</CODE
>) shows a few other lines. The
     <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>2 NAME</CODE
> line gives the person's name
     as recorded in the source (only <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>1
     NAME</CODE
> lines must follow <ACRONYM
CLASS="acronym"
>GEDCOM</ACRONYM
>
     format). The <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>2 AGE</CODE
> line gives the
     person's age at the time of the event. The <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>2
     COUR</CODE
> line indicates the court where
     naturalization occurred.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     The final event is a death event (tag
     <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>DEAT</CODE
>). The <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>2
     CAUS</CODE
> line gives the cause of death.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     At the end of the record are three lines that refer to family
     records. A <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>1 FAMC</CODE
> line refers to a
     family record that the person belongs to as a child; its value
     is the cross-reference index value of that family.  A
     <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>1 FAMS</CODE
> line refers to a family
     record that the person belongs to as a spouse or parent.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     When using <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> to edit a
     person, you will not be able to edit the cross reference
     values on the <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>0 INDI</CODE

     <CODE

>1 FAMC</CODE

     When you create new records for your database, you are free to
     invent tags and structure your data in any way you see
     fit. However, it is good practice to use standard
     <ACRONYM
CLASS="acronym"
>GEDCOM</ACRONYM
> tags and value formats.
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN

     of conventions that you must obey. Within person records,
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> requires that you use
     <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>1 NAME</CODE
> and <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>1
     SEX</CODE
> lines with their special meanings and value
     formats. Though not required,
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN

     <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>1 BIRT</CODE

CLASS="structfield"
>1
     DEAT</CODE

CLASS="structfield"
>1 CHR</CODE
>, and
     <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>1 BURI</CODE
> lines for birth, death,
     baptism and burial events, respectively. In family records,
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> assumes you will use the
     <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>1 MARR</CODE
> event for marriage
     events. Within person records, you are not allowed to use
     <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>0 INDI</CODE

CLASS="structfield"
>1
     FAMC</CODE
> or <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>1 FAMS</CODE

     since these are used to maintain linkage information. Within
     family records, you are not allowed to use <CODE

CLASS="structfield"
>1 HUSB</CODE

     The indentation shown in the examples is not part of

     <SPAN

>LifeLines</SPAN

     After <SPAN

     Select an operation by striking the proper selection letter.

</P

     The browse operation lets you browse the database and perform
     many operations on the data. The search operation provides some
     simple wildcard search capabilities, which lead into browsing
     particular records. The add operation lets you add
     new information, and the delete operation removes
     information. The report operations read report
     programs and generates output reports. The modify character
     translation tables operation changes the translation
     tables. The miscellaneous utilities operation provides such
     things as backup and restore. The handle source, event and
     other records operation gives you access to these three record
     types. The quit operation closes the database and returns to
     <ACRONYM
CLASS="acronym"

</P

>&#13;
     The browse operation deserves special mention, because it
     provides a rich environment for searching, viewing, adding,
     modifying, merging and deleting information in the

     modes most of the time. The operations are all described in

CLASS="sect1"

NAME="AEN359"
>1.6. CODESET</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;
     After you have created a new database, and before you actually
     add any data to it, is the time to set the codeset to be used
     in the database.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     The codeset (or character encoding, to use precise Unicode
     terminology) is the decision as to how letters will be represented
     by the computer. If you have only ever used English letters in
     computing, you may not have had to encounter this issue, because as
     it happens, the English letters (a-z and A-Z) are stored numerically
     in the same fashion in almost all codesets used by computers. However,
     in the field of genealogy, you are especially likely to meet letters
     outside of the English alphabet (for example, accented vowels).

</P
><P
>&#13;
     You have fundamentally three choices as to what codeset to use in your
     database, listed below from easiest to most powerful.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     First, you may leave it entirely unspecified. This will give the 
     traditional lifelines behavior. This is really only suitable if either
     (a), you only use English (ASCII) data, or (b), you work in an 
     environment which entirely uses the same 8-bit codeset (eg, a GNU/Linux box
     which is all ISO-8859-15), and you only run lifelines in English.
     If you use any non-English data on MS-Windows, this is not likely to 
     be suitable, because the lifelines screens run in the console, but 
     you are likely to use MS-Windows applications either for editing or 
     for viewing output, and the MS-Windows console uses a different 
     codeset from MS-Windows applications. Also, if you use lifelines in a
     different language than English, this may not be suitable, because 
     the gettext message catalogs (for non-English interface) will not 
     be converted into your codeset.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     Second, you may specify a particular 8-bit codeset. Assuming that you
     have iconv and gettext installed (or you are using the MS-Windows version,
     which comes with these), you may specify any 8-bit codeset supported by
     iconv, and iconv supports quite many. A natural choice for Western European
     languages would be ISO-8859-1, or (for MS-Windows only) CP-1252. With this
     option, gettext language files will be converted to your codeset.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     Third, you may specify the use of UTF-8. This is a Unicode encoding, and
     is by far the most powerful option. In fact, this is the only really
     convenient way to be able to store, for example, names in English, names
     in Russian, and names in Greek, all in the same database, in their native
     scripts (alphabets).  In recent versions, lifelines has become more
     knowledgeable about handling UTF-8, so that, for example, upper &#38;
     lower casing only work correctly with versions from 3.0.28 on.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     To actually specify a codeset, enter it via the u(tility) o(ptions) page
     (which is documented below). From the main menu, in the English version,
     press u to reach the utility page, and then o to edit the user options. To

     Note: Before you add the first person to your database, you
     specify internal codeset (review the Codeset chapter for
     information).

</P
><P
>&#13;
     Normally you add persons to the database from the browsing
     modes, but when entering the first person there is no one in
     the database to browse to. To add the first person to a
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN

     the add operation from the main menu. You will be prompted
     with the add menu (described later).  Strike p to add a
     person. <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> creates a
     template of a <ACRONYM
CLASS="acronym"
>GEDCOM</ACRONYM

     puts you in a screen editor to edit the template. The default
     template is:

     Edit the template to create the new person's record. Change

     deleting either <KBD
CLASS="userinput"
>M</KBD
> or
     <KBD
CLASS="userinput"
>F</KBD
>. Fill out the birth and death events
     as best you can. If the person is alive, remove the death
     event. Remove any <CODE

>DATE</CODE
> and
     <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>PLAC</CODE
> lines you do not have the
     information for.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     The default template provides lines for one birth and one
     death event. You can expand the record with other events (even
     more birth or death events) and lines. Indentation makes it
     easier to read and edit the record, but isn't necessary. You
     may change the default edit template by defining the user
     option <CODE

     When you finish editing and leave the editor, you

     When the record is in proper format,
     <SPAN

     With <SPAN

     other genealogical programs where screens or forms are used to
     gather the data.The default screen editor for

     <SPAN

CLASS="envar"
>ED</CODE
>, <CODE
CLASS="envar"
>EDITOR</CODE

     <CODE
CLASS="envar"

>&#13;
     There are four other, <SPAN

     specific environment variables. They are

     list variables.  

</P
><P
>&#13;     There is also a configuration file, and
     entries in it may be used in lieu of environment variables.
     It is ordinarily named .linesrc under <ACRONYM
CLASS="acronym"
>UNIX</ACRONYM

     <CODE
CLASS="envar"
>LLDATABASES</CODE

     that hold <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> databases. When
     you execute the <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN

     these directories will be searched in turn for the database
     mentioned on the command line. For example,
     <KBD
CLASS="userinput"

>LLDATABASES</CODE
>=<TT
CLASS="replaceable"
><I
>.:/home/ttw4/LifeLines/Databases</I

     directory first, and if not found there, then searched for in:
     <TT

>

</P
><P
>&#13;
     Each <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> database is
     implemented as a directory with specific contents. The
     <CODE
CLASS="envar"
>LLDATABASES</CODE
> variable should be set to a list of
     directories that contain these database directories, not to a
     list of database directories themselves.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     The environment variable <CODE
CLASS="envar"
>LLPROGRAMS</CODE
> is used in
     the same way, but to specify the search path for
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN

     other programs (described later).

</P
><P
>&#13;
     <CODE
CLASS="envar"
>LLARCHIVES</CODE

CLASS="envar"
>LLREPORTS</CODE
> can
     each be set to specify a single
     directory. <CODE
CLASS="envar"
>LLARCHIVES</CODE
> is used to select a
     directory where all database backup files will be stored, and
     <CODE

     all generated reports and program outputs will be placed.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     New databases without explicit paths will be created in the
     first directory listed in the LLDATABASES path. (This is a 
     change; versions from 3.0.6 to 3.0.31 used a now obsolete
     variable LLNEWDBDIR).

</P
><P
>&#13;
     You are not required to use these environment variables; when
     a variable is not defined,
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> uses the current
     directory as its default value. If you do use the variables,
     you can override their use by specifying files and directories
     as either absolute or relative paths.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     You may use the configuration file in
     lieu of environment variables. This is especially oriented towards
     users on <ACRONYM
CLASS="acronym"
>MS-Windows</ACRONYM
> systems, on which
     environment variables are not as common a configuration technique.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     <SPAN

>&#13;
     You will use the browsing screens of
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> most of the time. When in
     these modes you can quickly search for or browse through the
     persons and families in the database. When you find a person
     or family you are interested in, you can then edit their
     records.

</P
><P
>&#13;     The browsing screens also allow you to add new persons and
     families to the database, add spouses to families, add
     children to families, swap the order of spouses and children,
     merge persons and merge families, and perform other
     operations. The browsing screens also lets you remove spouses
     from families and remove children from families.
</P
><P
>&#13;     There are six browsing screens. The person and family screens
     concentrate on a single person and family, respectively. The
     list screen allows you to browse through a list of persons. The
     two person browse screen shows two persons at once, and the
     two family browse screen shows two families at once. The
     auxiliary screen is used browsing any other type of records
     (e.g., events, sources, notes).

</P
><P
>&#13;     Each browsing screen has multiple
     view modes. The view mode affects how the information is displayed
     on the screen, but does not affect the menu choices available at
     the bottom of the screen. Menu commands are available on each screen
     to change amongst the view modes available for that screen.
</P
><P
>&#13;     The person screen has the most view modes. It has normal mode,
     which shows a summary of the vital records of the person. It (like
     all other screens) has GEDCOM mode, which shows the actual GEDCOM
     data of the record, and also expanded GEDCOM mode, which shows the
     actual GEDCOM data, but augments it with information on each line
     that contains a cross-reference (GEDCOM xref). It has two pedigree
     or tree modes, one showing an ancestral tree and one showing a
     descendant tree. The depth of the pedigree trees shown may be
     adjusted via menu commands.
</P
><P
>&#13;     The two person browse screen has the same modes as the person
     screen.
</P
><P
>&#13;     The two family browse screen and tandem family screen alike have
     normal mode (showing a summary of vitals), GEDCOM mode, and
     expanded GEDCOM mode.
</P

     strike return.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> allows wide flexibility
     in how to enter names. You may enter a name in upper or lower
     case or any combination. You may leave out all but the first
     given name, and, for given names, you may leave out any
     letters except the first. You may leave vowels out of the
     surname, and after four or five consonants have been typed,
     you may leave them out too. You must separate the given names
     from the surname by a slash, and if you enter given names
     after the surname (as in Chinese names), or any modifiers
     (such as Jr, Sr, IV, etc.), they must be separated from the
     surname by another slash. Here are a few of the ways I can
     enter my name:

     You may browse to the list of all persons with the same

>Example 1-8.

</B
></P
><P
CLASS="literallayout"
>*/wetmore</P
></DIV
>matches all
     persons with surname Wetmore. This is the only wildcard
     feature supported in browsing. (However, the search operation
     provides some simple wildcards for
     finding individual name fragments, or searching by user-defined
     reference keys. The search operation is accessed via a different
     choice off of the main menu.)

</P
><P
>&#13;
     After you enter a name, <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
>
     searches for all persons who match. There are three
     possibilities: no one matches; one person matches; or more
     than one person matches. In the first case
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> writes: 
     <PRE
CLASS="screen"
>There is no one in the database with that name or key.</PRE
>
     and leaves you in the main menu.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     If one person matches, <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
>
     enters the person browse mode displaying the matched
     person. If more than one person matches,
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> enters the list browsing
     mode with the list of matching persons.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     You may also identify a person by entering his or her
     internal, cross-reference key value. The internal key values
     of all person records are an I followed by digits.
     When you enter a key value you may omit the I.
     If <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> finds a person with
     the key value you provide,
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> enters the person
     browsing mode displaying that person.  You can also browse to
     a Family, Source, or Note by entering it's key, but you must
     include the letter identifing the key type, thus F11, S1, or N3
     would browse to the family, source or note corresponding to the key
     if it exists.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     The browse command b is also available from most browsing
     modes. The command works the same way from those modes as it

     When <SPAN

>1.22. CODESET CONVERSION</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;
     (This section was previously entitled CHARACTER TRANSLATION.)

</P
><P
>&#13;
     The intention is that you need only specify the internal codeset for
     each database you create (and this step may be automated via the NewDbProps
     property), and all else works pretty well without tuning. That is,
     lifelines tries to guess the correct codeset for your environment (including
     guessing the console and windows codesets when operating under MS-Windows,
     which it should do fairly well).

</P
><P
>&#13;
     However, you may encounter situations where you wish to alter the codeset
     behavior, or the codeset conversion is not operating correctly (in which case
     we hope you will report the problem to the mailing list and/or sourceforge
     bugs list).

</P
><P
>&#13;
     There are two ways to amend codeset conversion. The first method is by
     changing configuration variables. For example, if you wish to generate an
     HTML report of all your data, which includes names in Russian (in Cyrillic
     letters), for your cousin, and you know that your cousin's computer has no
     font for Cyrillic letters, you might wish to temporarily adjust your
     report output codeset so that you will get interpolated ASCII letters for
     the Russian letters. You could do this by temporarily altering the
     configuration variable ReportCodesetOut to be "ASCII" (actually, if any of
     your data has characters in it that are reserved in HTML, such as the less
     than sign, or the ampersand, you would probaby want "ASCII//HTML").

</P
><P
>&#13;
     The second way to change codeset conversion, and the only way in lifelines
     3.0.6, is to edit the embedded character translation tables, in which you
     actually specify the letters you want converted, letter by letter, and how
     you want them converted.  This method, unlike the first, even works in
     databases with no specified internal codeset.  </P
><P
>&#13;
If you choose the modify character translation tables operation from the main menu, <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> displays
the character translation menu:
<PRE
CLASS="screen"
>&#13;Which character mapping do you want to edit?

   m Internal to Editor mapping
   i GEDCOM to Internal mapping

   d Internal to Display mapping
   r Internal to Report mapping
   q Return to main menu

</P
><P
>&#13;
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN

     text from one form to another, and lifelines supports five different
     forms.

     When converting text from one form to another
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> normally uses iconv conversion, and
     codesets specified in configuration variables. This may be augmented by
     codeset translation or extension using the text conversion (*.tt) files in
     the tt subdirectory. To use the tables in the tt subdirectory,
     you need to set
     the property "TTPATH" in your <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
>
     configuration file to the path of the tt directory.  There are two types
     of files in this directory. 
     
</P
><P
>&#13;     
     Files of the form &#60;codeset&#62;_&#60;codeset1&#62;.tt convert from one 
     codeset to another. For example, CP1250_UTF-8.tt can be used to convert
     characters in codeset CP1250 to their representations in UTF-8.
     
</P
><P
>&#13;
     Files of the form &#60;codeset&#62;__&#60;subcodeset&#62;.tt apply a
     conversion within the codeset, for example, UTF-8__html.tt is a
     sub-conversion that converts UTF-8 characters that have special escape
     codes within html to those special codes.  For example, specifing the
     report codeset to be UTF-8//html will apply the html sub-conversion to
     all the data being written.  Probably not what you really wanted.
     See the report language function convertcode() in the reportmanual for
     details.

</P
><P
>&#13;     
     If your system lacks iconv, or you need more specialized
     conversion than provided with iconv, you may either write a text
     conversion file (a tt file), or you may edit one of the in-database
     translation tables.
 
</P
><P
>&#13;
     The in-database translation tables convert between forms (as listed
     above). Every translation table converts either to the internal form, or
     from the internal form. That is, the internal form is used as an
     intermediate step in all operations. There are six supported translation
     tables.  The following table shows the six tables and describes when they
     are applied:

After you select a translation table you are placed in the editor to edit the table. Translation tables are
made up of lines that look like:
<PRE
CLASS="synopsis"
><TT
CLASS="replaceable"
><I
>pattern</I
></TT
> <TT
CLASS="replaceable"
><I
>pattern</I
></TT
></PRE
>
where a tab separates the patterns. Each pattern is an arbitrary sequence of verbatim <ACRONYM
CLASS="acronym"
>ASCII</ACRONYM
> characters
and escape sequences. Translation occurs by finding all occurrences that match left patterns and
replacing them with the corresponding right patterns.

</P
><P
>&#13;There are five escape mechanisms used in patterns:
</P
><DIV
CLASS="glosslist"
><DL
><DT
><B
>#nnn</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;nnn is a decimal character value
</P
></DD
><DT
><B
>$hh</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;hh is a hexadecimal character value
</P
></DD
><DT
><B
>\ #</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;represents the # character
</P
></DD
><DT
><B
>\$</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;represents the $ character
</P
></DD
><DT
><B
>\\</B
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;represents the \ character
</P
></DD
></DL
></DIV
><P
>&#13;
     It is possible, and desirable, to provide a short name for
     the translation table, using the "##!name: " command. An 
     example would be

</P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;##!name: UTF-8 to latex
</PRE
><P
>&#13;
     Naming the translation table is desirable because these 
     names are displayed, at least in part and if they fit, on
     the translation table menu.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     It is possible to format the file using a character other than
     tab as the separator between source and destination code. To do
     requires using the "##!sep" command. Those exact six characters
     must begin the line, and then the next character is the new
     separator for all following lines. For clarity, this should only
     occur once, and near the top of the file before any actual
     translation lines, and a fairly clear separator should be used
     (e.g., the equal sign "=").

</P
><P
>&#13;
     Any line which is blank, or which begins with two hash marks (##), is
     ignored. Therefore, comments begin with two hash marks.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     For advanced users, it is possible to mix different types of 
     conversion, for example iconv conversion and also translation
     table conversion, in the same form step. For example, it is possible
     to convert internal database text (internal form) first via the
     "internal to GEDCOM" in-database translation table, and then via
     the iconv conversion from configured internal codeset to configured
     GEDCOM codeset. In-database translation tables are always applied
     in the internal codeset, so when converting to the internal form,
     they are applied after iconv and/or tt conversions, and when
     converting from internal form, they are applied first.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     An example of adding a mixin in-database translation table might
     be to escape certain characters which are control characters
     to an output computer language, e.g., latex. One could create an
     "Internal to Report" mapping in UTF-8 (if the database is internally
     UTF-8) to escape any characters that may occur in place names or
     textual descriptions and inadvertently cause grief in latex
     processing.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     However, in this case, one could also write a tt file to achieve
     the same results, and be shared across databases, by naming it, eg,
     UTF-8__latex.tt. The double underscore ("__") signifies that this
     is a conversion to be applied to text which is in UTF-8, and to 
     trigger lifelinesn to use this, one must specify a report codeset
     such as "UTF-8//latex" (if UTF-8 output is desired, but with the
     latex conversion first applied), or "ISO-8859-1//latex" (if 
     ISO-8859-1 output is desired, but with the latex conversion first
     applied).

where option is the name of an option and value is the option's string value.
If the value is more than one line long, then the last character in each
non-final line must be a backslash. The escapes \n and \t are also recognized
in version 3.0.7 and better (to represent a carriage return and a tab, respectively).
These (\n and \t) are primarily for use in custom record templates.
In version 3.0.14 there are 39 options. Note that all of these may also be specified in
the configuration file, to apply to all databases, but if specified in
both places, the entry in the database (user options table) governs.
For more information, see the sample configuration file; each option is preceded
by a brief explanation.

you would edit the user option file to contain:<DIV

or, using the \n escape so as to keep the entry on one line:<DIV

An XREF is the internal name used to Identify a family, individual, note,
source or other record.  An XREF is bracked by two @ signs.  As an example
</P

to other individuals by specifing their XREF values.  Also I25, I26 and I17
are XREF values of individuals. 
</P
><P
>&#13;XREF values used within <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> are totally under
the control of <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
>.
The values that are used are always of the form, a single letter, followed by
a number.  However, when importing a gedcom
<SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> should accept almost
anything as an XREF, converting it to what is needed for internal use.
For the curious, the letters that <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> uses
are I for Individual, F for Family, S for Source, E for Events, and X for
other records.

></H2
><P
>&#13;
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> supports source, event
     and other, user-defined record types.  You can access these
     features in two ways: either through the x operation from the
     main menu, or via commands in the individual and family browse
     screens.  The first approach might be most convenient when you
     are solely working with these record types.  The second makes
     it easier to work with source, event and user-defined records
     in parallel with your person and family records; this can be
     useful for instance when you want to create references from
     your person and family record to your source, event and user
     defined records as you create them, and to view and edit
     records that you have referenced from within a person or
     family record.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     Using the first of these two possibilities
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> displays the following
     menu:

<PRE
CLASS="screen"
>&#13;What activity do you want to perform?

  s  Browse source records
  e  Browse event records
  x  Browse other records
  1  Add a source record to the database
  2  Edit source record from the database
  3  Add an event record to the database
  4  Edit event record from the database
  5  Add an other record to the database
  6  Edit other record from the database
  q  Return to main menu
</PRE
>

     Using the second variant (from the person and family browse
     screens), the following six commands are available. The first
     three are described alongside with their counterparts in the x
     menu (they do mostly, but not entirely, the same things); the
     last three are described separately:

<PRE
CLASS="screen"
>&#13;  %s  Add source
  %e  Add event

     The handling of source, event and user-defined records in

     and puts you in the screen editor to edit the template. The

     Do not change the <CODE

     <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>1 REFN</CODE

     can use to give the source a symbolic name that can be used in
     other records to refer to the source record. See the section
     on using <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>REFN</CODE
> values. Because many
     sources have a title and an author, the default template has
     these lines. You may adjust the source template via the
     SOURREC user option (either at the database level, via the
     user options, or globally, via the configuration file). Here

></H2
><P
>&#13;
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> 3.0.2 has relaxed most of
     restrictions on family structure that were imposed by earlier
     versions. For example, a family record may have more than one
     parent/spouse of the same sex; a person may be a child in more
     than family. This is a controversial issue. Some users insist
     that family relationships should imply biological relatedness,
     and that all other relationships should be handled by
     different means. Others insist that non-traditional families
     (any number of parents/spouses of any sex) should be allowed,
     and that children can be members of more than one family (eg,
     natural family and adoptive
     family). <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> no longer takes
     a position on this matter; you are free to set up families any
     way you like; the operations that add spouses and children to
     families no longer check for non-traditional arrangements. It
     is possible that a future release will include a user option
     to either disallow or to ask for confirmation about
     non-traditional relationships.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> provides features for
     merging persons together and for merging families
     together. The person merging feature is accessed from the
     tandem person browse mode, and the family merging feature is
     accessed from the tandem family browse mode. You browse to the
     two persons or families you want to merge and then use the j
     command. Merging is necessary when you discover that two or
     more person records, or two or more family records, represent
     the same person or family, respectively.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     Versions of <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> prior to
     3.0.2 required that persons and families meet certain criteria
     before they could be merged. The criteria ensured that the
     merged persons and families would still meet traditional
     family structuring rules. With the relaxation of the
     structuring rules, restrictions on merging have also been
     removed. It is now possible to create non-traditional
     relationships by merging traditional persons and/or
     families. For example, if you merge two persons that happen to
     be children in two different families, the merged person will
     be a child in both families. If you want to maintain only
     traditional relationships in your database you may have to
     makes further to changes to relationships after you complete a
     merge operation.

></H2
><P
>&#13;
     Records in a <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> database may
     refer to other records via cross-reference links. The
     lineage-linked references are maintained directly by
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> through operations found
     in the browsing mode menus.  These references are the links
     from a person to families (<CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>1 FAMC</CODE
>
     and <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>1 FAMS</CODE
>), and the links from a
     family to persons (<CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>1 HUSB</CODE
>,
     <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>1 WIFE</CODE
> and <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>1
     CHIL</CODE
>). Because
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> maintains these links you
     are not allowed to change these lines when you are editing
     records. There are a couple of seeming exceptions to this
     rule. For example, you may change the order of <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>1
     CHIL</CODE
> lines in a family record in order to change
     the order of children in a family, and you may change the
     order of <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>1 FAMS</CODE
> lines in a person
     record to change the order of families the person was a spouse
     or parent in. These operations are allowed because they don't
     affect which person records refer to which family records and
     vice versa.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     Besides the lineage-links that are maintained by
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
>, you may place your own
     links in records.  Probably the most common example of this is
     referring events within a person record to the record of the
     information source for the event. For example:


<DIV

The <CODE
CLASS="structfield"

> <TT
CLASS="replaceable"

CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> allows any specific
structure within a record (in this case a birth event) to refer to another record. It is not possible to refer
to a specific location within another record, though this may be supported eventually.


</P
><P
>&#13;
This example implies that when linking one record to another you must know the key of the target
record (S3 in the example). This is not desirable because internal record keys may change when the
records are exported from one database or imported to another.

</P
><P
>&#13;
     Because internal key values are not permanent,
     <SPAN
CLASS="application"
>LifeLines</SPAN
> allows you to assign a
     permanent user-defined key to any record in the database using
     the <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>1 REFN</CODE
> line. The value of this
     line is a string that you choose as your permanent key value
     for the record. When adding a link to a record that has a user
     <CODE
CLASS="structfield"
>REFN</CODE
> key value, you may use that
     value instead of the internal key value. For example, when
     adding the person in the previous example you could edit the
     new record as follows:

<DIV
CLASS="example"
><A
NAME="AEN1708"
></A
><P

     Instead of using the actual key value of the source, S3, the

</P

>&#13;
     The <CODE

     when searching for person, source, event and user-defined

writing a number of User Properties are predefined with specific meanings.
These User Property Names begin with 'user.' and are listed below.  For
example, many reports have abstracted the concept of the user's name to
the property user.fullname.  By defining this property in your llines startup
file, it allows a report to reference your name as the source of the data
being printed without having it hard-coded in the report.
