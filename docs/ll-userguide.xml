INTRODUCTION 

</title> 
       
       
       
<para> 

     <application>LifeLines</application> is a genealogy program 
     that runs on <acronym>UNIX</acronym> systems. It maintains 
     genealogical records (persons, families, sources, events and 
     others) in a database, and generates reports from those 
     records. There are no practical limits on the number of 
     records that can be stored in a 
     <application>LifeLines</application> database, nor on the 
     amounts or kinds of data that can be kept in the 
     records. <application>LifeLines</application> does not contain 
     built-in reports.  Instead it provides a programming subsystem 
     that you use to program your own reports and charts. The 
     programming subsystem also lets you query your databases and 
     process your data in any 
     way. <application>LifeLines</application> uses the terminal 
     independent features of <acronym>UNIX</acronym> to provide a 
     screen and menu based user interface. 

</para> 



<para> 

     <application>LifeLines</application> is a non-commercial, 
     experimental system that is use at your own risk software. I 
     developed <application>LifeLines</application> for personal 
     use and shared it with friends. Enough of a demand arose 
     through word of mouth and internet, that I have made the 
     <application>LifeLines</application> source code and other 
     information freely available under an MIT-style license

INSTALLATION 

</title> 



<para> 

     You may be installing <application>LifeLines</application> 
     from a source distribution package or as an executable program 
     already prepared for your <acronym>UNIX</acronym> 
     (or <acronym>MS-Windows</acronym>) system. The 
     source distribution comes with the readme, build script and 
     make files necessary to build 
     <application>LifeLines</application>. Follow the instructions 
     in the readme file. The executable program will be named 
     <command>llines</command>. <command>llines</command> is the 
     <application>LifeLines</application> program; put it in a 
     directory in your execution path. If you get the program in 
     executable form, follow whatever instructions came with it. 
     The source distribution package also contains documentation 
     and some <application>LifeLines</application> programs.

STARTING <application>LIFELINES</application> AND CREATING DATABASES 

</title> 



<para> 

     You normally start <application>LifeLines</application> with 
     the command: <userinput><command>lines</command> <replaceable class="parameter">database</replaceable></userinput> where 
     database is the name of a <application>LifeLines</application> 
     database. If <application>LifeLines</application> finds the 
     database, <application>LifeLines</application> opens the 
     database and takes you to the program's main menu. If the 
     database doesn't exist, <application>LifeLines</application> 
     asks whether it should create it, and if you answer yes, does 
     so. You may create any number of databases, but only one can 
     be accessed by <application>LifeLines</application> at a 
     time. If you built the <application>LifeLines</application> 
     executable from the source package, the executable may be 
     named <command>llines</command> rather than 
     <command>lines</command>. You may either change its name or 
     invoke <application>LifeLines</application> by using the 
     command <command>llines</command> instead.

     <application>LifeLines</application> is:

</para> 


<para> 

     The <option>-r</option> option opens the database with read-only 
     access. When in this mode 
     <application>LifeLines</application> will not let you modify 
     the database; no other operations are affected. The 
     <option>-w</option> option opens the database with writeable 
     access. If the database cannot be opened with the requested 
     mode <application>LifeLines</application> quits 
     immediately. When you open a database with neither the 
     <option>-r</option> or <option>-w</option> options, 
     <application>LifeLines</application> first tries to open the 
     database with writeable access; if not possible 
     <application>LifeLines</application> then tries to open the 
     database with read-only access; and if this is not possible 
     <application>LifeLines</application> quits. A 
     <application>LifeLines</application> database may be open 
     simultaneously by any number of programs with read-only 
     access; however, if a database is open by a program with 
     writeable access, then it cannot be opened by any other other 
     program. 

</para> 



<para> 

     In rare situations the read/write mode mechanism can fail; 
     when this happens a database may appear unopenable. If this 
     happens use the <option>-f</option> option to force open the 
     database; this will open the database and reset the mode 
     mechanism. This is a dangerous feature; you can use it to open 
     the same database with writeable access more than once; the 
     results are unpredictable and generally disasterous. 

</para> 

<para> 

     The multiuser protection supplied by this reader/writer access 
     mechanism is provided via a flag setting in the database, so both 
     read-only and writeable access actually alter the database (read-only 
     access only alters the value of this flag). For truly read-only 
     access, e.g., for use with read-only media, the best solution is to 
     lock (-ly) the      database before copying it to the read-only media. This 
     annotates the database itself as being for immutable access. 
     Alternatively, to use a database already on read-only media and not 
     so annotated, use the immutable (-i) flag. 

</para> 

<para> 

     If you don't give the name of a database on the command line, 
     <application>LifeLines</application> will prompt you for 
     it. If you do not use the <envar>LLDATABASES</envar> shell 
     variable or user options (described later), the name you enter must be the 
     name of a <application>LifeLines</application> database 
     directory expressed using normal <acronym>UNIX</acronym> 
     absolute or relative path naming. If you do use the 
     <envar>LLDATABASES</envar> variable, 
     <application>LifeLines</application> will search for the 
     database in the directories named in the variable; this can be 
     very convenient. 

</para> 

<para>

     If you would like to choose a database from a list of existing ones,
     enter a single question mark and press return when
     <application>LifeLines</application> prompts you for the database name.
     <application>LifeLines</application> will then display a list of all
     databases that it can find, and you may select one from the list.

INTRODUCTION TO <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> 

</title> 



<para> 

     <application>LifeLines</application> records are stored in 
     <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> format; you organize, edit and 
     maintain your data in this format. <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> 
     is a standard that defines a file format for moving 
     genealogical data between computer 
     systems. <application>LifeLines</application> has adopted this 
     format for structuring the records in its databases. This 
     approach provides a structured yet flexible method for storing 
     all the data you wish to record. There are few restrictions on 
     the format, amount or type of information you may store in a 
     <application>LifeLines</application> database. 

</para> 



<para> 

     <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> is defined at two levels. At the 
     syntactic level <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> is a simple set of 
     rules for organizing and structuring data into records, with 
     no concern about the types of records, types or formats of 
     information in the records, or the relationships between 
     records. At the semantic level <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> adds 
     an additional set of rules that specify what record types are 
     allowed, how records must be structured, how data within the 
     records must be identified and formatted, and what specific 
     relationships between the record types are allowed. In 
     principle there can be multiple semantic versions of 
     <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym>, though in practice there is only 
     one, lineage-linked <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym>. Unfortunately 
     this semantic version of <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> is poorly 
     defined, and every genealogical system has interpreted it in 
     different ways. 

</para> 



<para> 

     <application>LifeLines</application> uses 
     <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> primarily at the syntactic level, 
     though it does impose a few of the generally accepted 
     lineage-linked semantic restrictions. This means some 
     important things. It means that you can store all your 
     genealogical data in your <application>LifeLines</application> 
     database, and that you have wide freedom in how you choose 
     your own conventions for structuring and formatting your 
     data. But it also means that the way you store data in your 
     databases can be different from the way that someone else 
     stores their data.  This can be a problem if you share data 
     with others or share report programs with other 
     <application>LifeLines</application> users. My recommendation 
     is to use <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> lineage-linking 
     conventions wherever possible. 

</para> 



<para> 

     <application>LifeLines</application> does not use forms or 
     screens to guide you through entering or changing 
     data. Instead you use a screen editor and directly edit the 
     data records. This requires you to understand the 
     <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> format, and be able to edit data in 
     <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> format, before you can use 
     <application>LifeLines</application>. The 
     <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> format is quite simple; this 
     introduction will provide all you need to know about 
     <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> in order to use 
     <application>LifeLines</application>.

</programlisting></example> 

</para> 



<para> 

     A <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> record is made up of lines. Each 
     line has a level number and a tag, and most lines have a value 
     following the tag. The first line in every record has a 
     cross-reference index between the level number and the tag. 

</para> 



<para> 

     Level numbers allow data to be structured to any degree of 
     detail; lines with higher level numbers expand on lines with 
     lower numbers. Each record begins at level 0, and each deeper 
     level increments the level by 
     one. <application>LifeLines</application> does not restrict 
     the structuring depth. Tags are uppercase (by convention) code 
     words that specify the kind of information on the line or on 
     the higher numbered lines that follow. The information after 
     the tag, if any, is the value of the line. 

</para> 



<para> 

     The first line in a record indicates its type. There are four 
     fixed record types in <application>LifeLines</application> 
     databases: person, family, source and event. The first, 0 
     level line in these records have tags 
     <structname>INDI</structname>, <structname>FAM</structname>, 
     <structname>SOUR</structname> and 
     <structname>EVEN</structname>, respectively. Besides these 
     record types, you may create your own record types by using 
     any other tag on the 0 level line of a record. The lines that 
     begin records are the only level 0 lines used in 
     <application>LifeLines</application>. Each level 0 line has a 
     cross-reference index between the level number and the 
     tag. This index is the record's internal reference key; other 
     records may refer to this record by using this index. 
     Cross-reference indexes are bracketed by @ characters. 

</para> 



<para> 

     The first line in the example record has the 
     <structname>INDI</structname> tag, identifying it as a 
     person. The cross-reference index value, I25, can be used by 
     other records to refer to this record. 

</para> 



<para> 

     The second line in the example has the person's name. Each 
     person record in a <application>LifeLines</application> 
     database must have at least one <structfield>1 
     NAME</structfield> line, and its value must be in 
     <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> name format. This format allows 
     names to be as long as needed, but the surname, which may be 
     placed anywhere in the name, must be separated from the rest 
     of the name by one or two slashes. For example: 

<example> 

<title> 
Example of NAME formats 

</title> 

<programlisting> 
1 NAME <userinput>John/Smith</userinput> 
1 NAME <userinput>John /Smith/</userinput> 
1 NAME <userinput>John/Smith/Jr.</userinput> 
</programlisting> 
</example> 

</para> 



<para> 

     The second slash is required only if name elements follow the 
     surname. White space is optional before the first slash and 
     after the second. If you don't know a person's surname, or the 
     person doesn't have a surname, you may use / or // or no 
     slashes at all. For example: 

<example> 

<title> 
Example of searching on NAMEs 
</title> 

<programlisting> 

1 NAME <userinput>Mary//</userinput> 
1 NAME <userinput>Mary/</userinput> 
1 NAME <userinput>Mary</userinput> 
</programlisting> 

</example> 

     are all ways to enter a person named Mary with no known 
     surname. A person may have any number, including zero, given 
     names and/or initials. A <application>LifeLines</application> 
     person record may have any number of <structfield>1 
     NAME</structfield> lines, though the person will be displayed 
     with the first name value only. Persons are indexed under all 
     their names, however, so you will be able to search for 
     persons by any of their names. 
</para> 



<para> 

     The next line in the example gives the person's 
     sex. <application>LifeLines</application> doesn't require a 
     <structfield>1 SEX</structfield> line, but you should include 
     it. The value of the line should be <userinput>M</userinput> 
     or <userinput>F</userinput> if the sex is known; it can be 
     left blank or set to <userinput>U</userinput> or 
     <userinput>?</userinput>, say, if not known. A person must 
     have a <structfield>1 SEX</structfield> line with a value of 
     either <userinput>M</userinput> or <userinput>F</userinput> 
     before he or she can be made a spouse or parent in a family. 

</para> 



<para> 

     The example record also contains three events: birth, 
     naturalization, and death. An event begins with a level 1 line 
     whose tag indicates the event type. For example, 
     <structfield>BIRT</structfield> is the tag for a birth event. 

</para> 



<para> 

     Events usually have at least a <structfield>2 
     DATE</structfield> and a <structfield>2 PLAC</structfield> 
     line and often a <structfield>2 SOUR</structfield> line. The 
     <structfield>DATE</structfield> and 
     <structfield>PLAC</structfield> lines give the date and place 
     of the event. The value of a 
     <application>LifeLines</application> 
     <structfield>DATE</structfield> line is free format, though 
     <application>LifeLines</application> will try to parse it for 
     specific day, month and year information. The value of a 
     <structfield>PLAC</structfield> line is usually a 
     comma-separated list of geopolitical units, starting with the 
     most specific, ending with the most general. The 
     <structfield>SOUR</structfield> line indicates the source of 
     information about the event. The 
     <structfield>SOUR</structfield> line can be the root of a full 
     description of the source, or the value of the 
     <structfield>SOUR</structfield> line can be a cross-reference 
     key that refers to the source record that describes the 
     source. 

</para> 



<para> 

     The naturalization event (with tag 
     <structfield>NATU</structfield>) shows a few other lines. The 
     <structfield>2 NAME</structfield> line gives the person's name 
     as recorded in the source (only <structfield>1 
     NAME</structfield> lines must follow <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> 
     format). The <structfield>2 AGE</structfield> line gives the 
     person's age at the time of the event. The <structfield>2 
     COUR</structfield> line indicates the court where 
     naturalization occurred. 

</para> 



<para> 

     The final event is a death event (tag 
     <structfield>DEAT</structfield>). The <structfield>2 
     CAUS</structfield> line gives the cause of death. 

</para> 



<para> 

     At the end of the record are three lines that refer to family 
     records. A <structfield>1 FAMC</structfield> line refers to a 
     family record that the person belongs to as a child; its value 
     is the cross-reference index value of that family.  A 
     <structfield>1 FAMS</structfield> line refers to a family 
     record that the person belongs to as a spouse or parent. 

</para> 



<para> 

     When using <application>LifeLines</application> to edit a 
     person, you will not be able to edit the cross reference 
     values on the <structfield>0 INDI</structfield>, 
     <structfield>1 FAMC</structfield> or <structfield>1 
     FAMS</structfield> lines; these are maintained by 
     <application>LifeLines</application>. 

</para> 



<para> 

     Here is an example family record: 

<example> 

<title>

  1 CHIL @I17@</programlisting></example> 

</para> 



<para> 

     The <structfield>0 FAM</structfield> line assigns the family 
     the cross-reference index of F6. The record contains 
     <structfield>1 HUSB</structfield> and <structfield>1 
     WIFE</structfield> lines that refer to the two 
     spouses/parents. The record also holds a marriage event (tag 
     <structfield>MARR</structfield>) and two <structfield>1 
     CHIL</structfield> lines that refer to two children in the 
     family. When editing family records, you cannot edit the 
     <structfield>0 FAM</structfield>, <structfield>1 
     HUSB</structfield>, <structfield>1 WIFE</structfield>, or 
     <structfield>1 CHIL</structfield> lines; these are maintained 
     by <application>LifeLines</application>. 

</para> 

<para> 

     When you create new records for your database, you are free to 
     invent tags and structure your data in any way you see 
     fit. However, it is good practice to use standard 
     <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> tags and value formats. 
     <application>LifeLines</application> does enforce a small set 
     of conventions that you must obey. Within person records, 
     <application>LifeLines</application> requires that you use 
     <structfield>1 NAME</structfield> and <structfield>1 
     SEX</structfield> lines with their special meanings and value 
     formats. Though not required, 
     <application>LifeLines</application> assumes that you will use 
     <structfield>1 BIRT</structfield>, <structfield>1 
     DEAT</structfield>, <structfield>1 CHR</structfield>, and 
     <structfield>1 BURI</structfield> lines for birth, death, 
     baptism and burial events, respectively. In family records, 
     <application>LifeLines</application> assumes you will use the 
     <structfield>1 MARR</structfield> event for marriage 
     events. Within person records, you are not allowed to use 
     <structfield>0 INDI</structfield>, <structfield>1 
     FAMC</structfield> or <structfield>1 FAMS</structfield> lines, 
     since these are used to maintain linkage information. Within 
     family records, you are not allowed to use <structfield>0 
     FAM</structfield>, <structfield>1 HUSB</structfield>, 
     <structfield>1 WIFE</structfield> or <structfield>1 
     CHIL</structfield> lines. 

</para> 



<para> 

     The indentation shown in the examples is not part of 
     <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> format. When 
     <application>LifeLines</application> prepares records for you 
     to edit, however, it always indents the records, making them 
     easier to read and understand. You do not need to follow this 
     indentation scheme when you edit the records. Indentation is 
     removed from the data before it is stored in the database.

MAIN MENU 

</title> 



<para> 

     After <application>LifeLines</application> opens an existing 
     database, or creates a new one, it presents you with the main 
     menu: 

<screen> 
Please choose an operation: 
   b Browse the persons in the database 
   s Search database 
   a Add information to the database 
   d Delete information from the database 
   p Pick a report from list and run 
   r Generate reports from the database

</para> 

<para> 

     Select an operation by striking the proper selection letter. 

</para> 



<para> 

     The browse operation lets you browse the database and perform 
     many operations on the data. The search operation provides some 
     simple wildcard search capabilities, which lead into browsing 
     particular records. The add operation lets you add 
     new information, and the delete operation removes 
     information. The report operations read report 
     programs and generates output reports. The modify character 
     translation tables operation changes the translation 
     tables. The miscellaneous utilities operation provides such 
     things as backup and restore. The handle source, event and 
     other records operation gives you access to these three record 
     types. The quit operation closes the database and returns to 
     <acronym>UNIX</acronym>. 

</para> 



<para> 

     The browse operation deserves special mention, because it 
     provides a rich environment for searching, viewing, adding, 
     modifying, merging and deleting information in the 
     database. You will find that you operate from the browsing 
     modes most of the time. The operations are all described in 
     later sections.

ENTERING THE FIRST PERSON 

</title> 



<para> 

     Normally you add persons to the database from the browsing 
     modes, but when entering the first person there is no one in 
     the database to browse to. To add the first person to a 
     <application>LifeLines</application> database, first select 
     the add operation from the main menu. You will be prompted 
     with the add menu (described later).  Strike p to add a 
     person. <application>LifeLines</application> creates a 
     template of a <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> person record, and 
     puts you in a screen editor to edit the template. The default 
     template is: 

<example> 
<title> 
Default person record template 
</title> 

<programlisting> 

  0 INDI 
  1 NAME <replaceable>Fname /Surname/</replaceable> 
  1 SEX <replaceable>MF</replaceable> 
  1 BIRT 
    2 DATE 
    2 PLAC 
    2 SOUR 
  1 DEAT 
    2 DATE 
    2 PLAC 
    2 SOUR</programlisting></example> 

</para> 



<para> 

     Edit the template to create the new person's record. Change 
     the name to the person's name. Assign the person's sex by 
     deleting either <userinput>M</userinput> or 
     <userinput>F</userinput>. Fill out the birth and death events 
     as best you can. If the person is alive, remove the death 
     event. Remove any <structfield>DATE</structfield> and 
     <structfield>PLAC</structfield> lines you do not have the 
     information for. 

</para> 



<para> 

     The default template provides lines for one birth and one 
     death event. You can expand the record with other events (even 
     more birth or death events) and lines. Indentation makes it 
     easier to read and edit the record, but isn't necessary. You 
     may change the default edit template by defining the user 
     option <option>INDIREC</option> (described later). 

</para> 



<para> 

     Here is how I might edit the template when creating a record 
     about myself:

</para> 



<para> 

     When you finish editing and leave the editor, you 
     automatically return to

     (eg, didn't use proper level numbers or didn't follow the 
     proper name convention), <application>LifeLines</application> 
     displays an error message, and asks if you want to re-edit the 
     record. If you don't, <application>LifeLines</application> 
     doesn't add the person to the database. 

</para> 



<para> 

     When the record is in proper format, 
     <application>LifeLines</application> asks if you are sure you

SCREEN EDITORS AND ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES 

</title> 



<para> 

     With <application>LifeLines</application> you maintain the 
     database records using a screen editor. This is different than 
     other genealogical programs where screens or forms are used to 
     gather the data.The default screen editor for 
     <application>LifeLines</application> is 
     <application>vi</application>. (The <acronym>MS-Windows</acronym> 
     version defaults instead to notepad.exe.) This can be overridden by the 
     <envar>ED</envar>, <envar>EDITOR</envar> or 
     <envar>LLEDITOR</envar> environment variables. For example, if 
     you prefer the emacs screen editor, and if you use a bourne-compatible 
     shell, you may add the line: 
     <userinput><envar>ED</envar>=<replaceable>emacs</replaceable></userinput> 
     to your login profile file, and 
     <application>LifeLines</application> will use 
     <application>emacs</application> for editing. 

</para> 



<para> 

     There are five other, <application>LifeLines</application> 
     specific environment variables. They are 
     <envar>LLDATABASES</envar>, <envar>LLARCHIVES</envar>, 
     <envar>LLPROGRAMS</envar>, <envar>LLREPORTS</envar>, 
     and <envar>LLNEWDBDIR</envar>. <envar>LLDATABASES</envar> and 
     <envar>LLPROGRAMS</envar> are <acronym>UNIX</acronym> path 
     list variables. (<envar>LLNEWDBDIR</envar> was added in version 
     3.0.6.) 

</para> 

<para> 
     As of version 3.0.6, there is also a configuration file, and 
     entries in it may be used in lieu of environment variables. 
     It is ordinarily named .linesrc under UNIX, and lines.cfg under 
     <acronym>MS-Windows</acronym>. 
     A sample configuration file should have been included 
     in the distribution.  
</para> 



<para> 

     <envar>LLDATABASES</envar> can be set to a list of directories 
     that hold <application>LifeLines</application> databases. When 
     you execute the <application>LifeLines</application> program, 
     these directories will be searched in turn for the database 
     mentioned on the command line. For example, 
     <userinput><envar>LLDATABASES</envar>=<replaceable>.:/home/ttw4/LifeLines/Databases</replaceable></userinput> 
     indicates that databases should be searched for in the current 
     directory first, and if not found there, then searched for in: 
     <filename>/usr/ttw4/LifeLines/Databases</filename> 

</para> 



<para> 

     Each <application>LifeLines</application> database is 
     implemented as a directory with specific contents. The 
     <envar>LLDATABASES</envar> variable should be set to a list of 
     directories that contain these database directories, not to a 
     list of database directories themselves. 

</para> 



<para> 

     The environment variable <envar>LLPROGRAMS</envar> is used in 
     the same way, but to specify the search path for 
     <application>LifeLines</application> report generating and 
     other programs (described later). 

</para> 



<para> 

     <envar>LLARCHIVES</envar> and <envar>LLREPORTS</envar> can 
     each be set to specify a single 
     directory. <envar>LLARCHIVES</envar> is used to select a 
     directory where all database backup files will be stored, and 
     <envar>LLREPORTS</envar> is used to select a directory where 
     all generated reports and program outputs will be placed. 

</para> 

<para> 

     <envar>LLNEWDBDIR</envar> may be set to specific a single  
     directory - new databases without paths will be created in this 
     location if given. This is of course a convenience for users  
     who generally put all their databases under a single common 
     directory. 

</para> 

<para> 

     You are not required to use these environment variables; when 
     a variable is not defined, 
     <application>LifeLines</application> uses the current 
     directory as its default value. If you do use the variables, 
     you can override their use by specifying files and directories 
     as either absolute or relative paths. 

</para> 

<para> 

     With version 3.0.6 or later, you may use the configuration file in 
     lieu of environment variables. This is especially oriented towards 
     users on <acronym>MS-Windows</acronym> systems, on which 
     environment variables are not as common a configuration technique. 

</para> 


<para> 

     <application>LifeLines</application> uses the curses library 
     for terminal independent I/O. This requires you to specify 
     your terminal type with the <envar>TERM</envar> environment 
     variable. (This is not relevant in the <acronym>MS-Windows</acronym> 
     version.)

BASICS OF BROWSING 

</title> 



<para> 

     You will use the browsing screens of 
     <application>LifeLines</application> most of the time. When in 
     these modes you can quickly search for or browse through the 
     persons and families in the database. When you find a person 
     or family you are interested in, you can then edit their 
     records. 

</para> 



<para> 
     The browsing screens also allow you to add new persons and 
     families to the database, add spouses to families, add 
     children to families, swap the order of spouses and children, 
     merge persons and merge families, and perform other 
     operations. The browsing screens also lets you remove spouses 
     from families and remove children from families. 
</para> 

<para> 
     There are six browsing screens. The person and family screens  
     concentrate on a single person and family, respectively. The 
     list screen allows you to browse through a list of persons. The 
     person tandem screen shows two persons at once, and the family 
     tandem screen shows two families at once. The auxiliary screen 
     is used browsing any other type of records (e.g., events,  
     sources, notes). (The auxiliary screen is new with version 3.0.6.) 

</para> 

<para> 
     Beginning with version 3.0.6, each browsing screen has multiple 
     view modes. The view mode affects how the information is displayed 
     on the screen, but does not affect the menu choices available at 
     the bottom of the screen. Menu commands are available on each screen 
     to change amongst the view modes available for that screen. 
</para> 

<para> 
     The person screen has the most view modes. It has normal mode,  
     which shows a summary of the vital records of the person. It (like 
     all other screens) has GEDCOM mode, which shows the actual GEDCOM 
     data of the record, and also expanded GEDCOM mode, which shows the 
     actual GEDCOM data, but augments it with information on each line 
     that contains a cross-reference (GEDCOM xref). It has two pedigree 
     or tree modes, one showing an ancestral tree and one showing a  
     descendant tree. The depth of the pedigree trees shown may be  
     adjusted via menu commands. 
</para> 

<para> 
     The tandem person screen has the same modes as the person screen. 
</para> 

<para> 
     The family screen and tandem family screen alike have normal mode 
     (showing a summary of vitals), GEDCOM mode, and expanded GEDCOM 
     mode.  
</para> 

<para> 
     The auxiliary screen has only GEDCOM mode and expanded GEDCOM mode. 
     (The list screen has no view modes at present).

IDENTIFYING A PERSON OR LIST OF PERSONS TO BROWSE 

</title> 



<para> 

     To enter the browsing modes from the main menu strike 
     b. <application>LifeLines</application> asks you to identify a 
     person or list of persons to browse to: 

<screen> 
Please identify person or persons to browse to. 
Enter name, key, refn or list: 
</screen> 

</para> 

<para> 

     Enter either a name or partial name, or an internal key value, 
     or a user-defined reference key (described later) or the name 
     of a previously defined list of persons (described later), and 
     strike return. 

</para> 



<para> 

     <application>LifeLines</application> allows wide flexibility 
     in how to enter names. You may enter a name in upper or lower 
     case or any combination. You may leave out all but the first 
     given name, and, for given names, you may leave out any 
     letters except the first. You may leave vowels out of the 
     surname, and after four or five consonants have been typed, 
     you may leave them out too. You must separate the given names 
     from the surname by a slash, and if you enter given names 
     after the surname (as in Chinese names), or any modifiers 
     (such as Jr, Sr, IV, etc.), they must be separated from the 
     surname by another slash. Here are a few of the ways I can 
     enter my name: 

<example> 

<title>

     You may browse to the list of all persons with the same 
     surname by using the * character as the first initial. For 
     example: 

<example> 

<title> 
Example of using wildcard in browsing

     persons with surname Wetmore. This is the only wildcard 
     feature supported in browsing. (However, the search operation, 
     added in version 3.0.6, provides some simple wildcards for 
     finding individual name fragments, or searching by user-defined 
     reference keys. The search operation is accessed via a different
     choice off of the main menu.)

<para> 

     After you enter a name, <application>LifeLines</application> 
     searches for all persons who match. There are three 
     possibilities: no one matches; one person matches; or more 
     than one person matches. In the first case 
     <application>LifeLines</application> writes: <screen>There is 
     no one in the database with that name.</screen> and leaves you 
     in the main menu. 

</para> 



<para> 

     If one person matches, <application>LifeLines</application> 
     enters the person browse mode displaying the matched 
     person. If more than one person matches, 
     <application>LifeLines</application> enters the list browsing 
     mode with the list of matching persons. 

</para> 



<para> 

     You may also identify a person by entering his or her 
     internal, cross-reference key value. The internal key values 
     of all person records are an I followed by digits. In the 
     current version, when you enter a key value you must omit the 
     I. If <application>LifeLines</application> finds a person with 
     the key value you provide, 
     <application>LifeLines</application> enters the person 
     browsing mode displaying that person. 

</para>

     The browse command b is also available from most browsing 
     modes. The command works the same way from those modes as it 
     does from the main menu.

ZIP IDENTIFYING A NEW PERSON 

</title> 



<para> 

     Some <application>LifeLines</application> operations need you 
     to identify a person, not for the purpose of browsing, but for 
     the purpose of completing an operation you have requested. For 
     example, when you add a child to a family, 
     <application>LifeLines</application> may ask you to identify 
     the child. When this happens a panel pops up that asks you to 
     identify a person. You respond by typing a name or key exactly 
     as you would for the b command. If no one matches, 
     <application>LifeLines</application> returns to the previous 
     browsing mode. If the name matches persons in the database 
     <application>LifeLines</application> displays something like:

<para> 

     Use the j and k commands to move the selection cursor (>) to 
     the correct person, and then use the i command to select that 
     person. There may be more persons in the list than you can see 
     at once. If this is so then you can use the j and k commands 
     to scroll through the full list. If you don't find the proper 
     person, use the q command and 
     <application>LifeLines</application> asks whether you want to 
     enter another name. 

</para>

     With version 3.0.15, lists may also be navigated with the up 
     and down arrows, PageUp and PageDown keys, Home and End keys.
     Shift-PageUp and Shift-PageDown move more than one page at a
     time in a given direction. The keyboard equivalents are

<para> 

     When <application>LifeLines</application> creates a list of 
     names for you to select from, it tries to add extra 
     information to the name; this helps determine which name to 
     choose, and is important in databases where many persons have 
     the same name. <application>LifeLines</application> also 
     places the person's key value at the end of each menu line; 
     this may be helpful in large databases.

     Some browse screens provide the z command, which allows you to

<para> 

     After you identify a person to browse to, 
     <application>LifeLines</application> enters the person browse 
     screen. The top panel in the display gives basic information 
     about the person (in the normal, or vitals, mode, which is the  
     default). The middle panel provides a menu of commands. 
     For example:

ADD OPERATION 

</title> 



<para> 

If you choose the add operation from the main menu, <application>LifeLines</application> displays the add menu: 
<screen> 
What do you want to add? 
  p Person - add new person to the database 
  f Family - create family record from one or two spouses 
  c Child - add a child to an existing family 
  s Spouse - add a spouse to an existing family 
  q Quit - return to the previous menu 
</screen> 


</para> 



<para> 

These operations work in a straightforward way. <application>LifeLines</application> asks you the necessary questions, and lets 
you cancel at any time. The operations provided by this menu are also available from the browsing 
modes, and are often easier to perform there.

What do you want to delete? 
  c Child - remove a child from his/her family 
  s Spouse - remove a spouse from a family 
  p Person - remove a person completely

<para> 

You may also remove a child from his/her family, or remove a spouse/parent from his/her family, 
from the person browsing mode. In both cases, only a relationship is removed, not a person. On the other 
hand, the delete menu must be used if you want to completely remove a person from the database; this 
cannot be done from the browsing mode. 


</para> 



<para> 

There is no special operation for removing a family record. <application>LifeLines</application> silently removes any family 
record that has no parent or child associated with it.

CHARACTER TRANSLATION

If you choose the modify character translation tables operation from the main menu, <application>LifeLines</application> displays 
the character translation menu: 
<screen>

   q Return to main menu 
</screen> 


</para> 



<para> 

<application>LifeLines</application> has little built-in knowledge of character codes. If you use 7-bit <acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters you will not 
encounter problems. However, many European and other languages require additional characters, and 
there are many 8-bit and other schemes for encoding those characters. <application>LifeLines</application> knows about none of 
them. However, <application>LifeLines</application> provides a number of character translation features you can use to manage 
character translation. 

</para> 



<para> 

<application>LifeLines</application> provides facilities for mapping between characters whenever a data record changes form. 
<application>LifeLines</application> supports four forms:<glosslist><glossentry><glossterm>internal</glossterm><glossdef>

When converting text from one form to another <application>LifeLines</application> normally does not convert characters codes. 
You may, however, override this default behavior by creating translation tables that <application>LifeLines</application> will 
use when converting between forms. There are six translation tables you may define. The following 
table shows the six tables and describes when they are applied:<glosslist><glossentry><glossterm>internal to editor</glossterm><glossdef>

After you select a translation table you are placed in the editor to edit the table. Translation tables are 
made up of lines that look like: 
<synopsis><replaceable>pattern</replaceable> <replaceable>pattern</replaceable></synopsis> 
where a tab separates the patterns. Each pattern is an arbitrary sequence of verbatim <acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters 
and escape sequences. Translation occurs by finding all occurrences that match left patterns and 
replacing them with the corresponding right patterns. 

</para> 



<para> 

There are five escape mechanisms used in patterns:<glosslist><glossentry><glossterm>#nnn</glossterm><glossdef>

This command saves the complete <application>LifeLines</application> database in a 
<acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> file. All person, family, event, source and user-defined records are stored. This command 
may be used to periodically back up your database. When you use this command, <application>LifeLines</application> asks you 
for the name of the file. If you have defined the <envar>LLARCHIVE</envar> shell variable, <application>LifeLines</application> will store 
the file in the directory named in the variable. 

</para> 

</glossdef></glossentry><glossentry><glossterm><keycap>r</keycap> <action>Read in data from a GEDCOM file.</action></glossterm><glossdef> 

<para> 

This command allows you restore a complete database from a 
<acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> file. When you select this command, <application>LifeLines</application> asks you for the name of the <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> file. 
This command can also be used to import data from a <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> file to an existing database. When 
<application>LifeLines</application> performs this command, it first reads the entire <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> file and checks it for validity. 
If there are problems in the file, <application>LifeLines</application> describes them, writing them to the file err.log, and does 
not add any records to the database. If there are no problems, <application>LifeLines</application> adds all the records found in 
the file to the database (only header and trailer records are not stored in the database).

<para> 

     This command allows you to edit the place abbreviations 
     file. This file defines the abbreviations that are used by 
     <application>LifeLines</application> when it creates lists of 
     persons for you to select from. Each line in the file has the 
     format:<synopsis><replaceable>word</replaceable>:<replaceable> 
     abbr </replaceable></synopsis>where word is a word to be 
     abbreviated, and abbr is its abbreviation. The word and its 
     abbreviation are separated by a colon. For example: 

<example> 

<title> 
Example of using abbreviations 
</title> 

<literallayout>Connecticut:Conn. 
Massachusetts:Mass. 
Nova Scotia:N.S.</literallayout></example> 

</para> 



<para> 

When <application>LifeLines</application> constructs lists of persons for you to select from, it looks up the last component of 
certain <structfield>PLAC</structfield> lines in this file, and if it finds that component, replaces it with its abbreviation. 

</para> 

</glossdef></glossentry><glossentry><glossterm><keycap>o</keycap> <action>Edit the user options file.</action></glossterm><glossdef> 

<para> 

This command allows you to edit the user options file. The user options file 
is a record kept in the database that holds user selectable options. Each 
option has a name and a string value. Each line in the options file has the 
format:<synopsis><replaceable>option</replaceable>=<replaceable>value</replaceable></synopsis> 
where option is the name of an option and value is the option's string value. 
If the value is more than one line long, then the last character in each 
non-final line must be a backslash. The escapes \n and \t are also recognized 
in version 3.0.7 and better (to represent a carriage return and a tab, respectively).
These (\n and \t) are primarily for use in custom record templates.
In version 3.0.14 there are 39 options. Note that all of these may also be specified in 
the configuration file, to apply to all databases, but if specified in  
both places, the entry in the database (user options table) governs. 
For more information, see the sample configuration file; each option is preceded
by a brief explanation.

HANDLING SOURCE, EVENT AND USER-DEFINED RECORDS 

</title> 



<para> 

     <application>LifeLines</application> supports source, event 
     and other, user-defined record types.  You can access these 
     features in two ways: either through the x operation from the 
     main menu, or via commands in the individual and family browse 
     screens.  The first approach might be most convenient when you 
     are solely working with these record types.  The second makes 
     it easier to work with source, event and user-defined records 
     in parallel with your person and family records; this can be 
     useful for instance when you want to create references from 
     your person and family record to your source, event and user 
     defined records as you create them, and to view and edit 
     records that you have referenced from within a person or 
     family record. 

</para> 

<para> 

     Using the first of these two possibilities 
     <application>LifeLines</application> displays the following 
     menu: 

<screen> 
What activity do you want to perform? 

  s  Browse source records 
  e  Browse event records 
  x  Browse other records 
  1  Add a source record to the database 
  2  Edit source record from the database 
  3  Add an event record to the database 
  4  Edit event record from the database 
  5  Add an other record to the database 
  6  Edit other record from the database 
  q  Return to main menu 
</screen> 

     Using the second variant (from the person and family browse 
     screens), the following six commands are available. The first 
     three are described alongside with their counterparts in the x 
     menu (they do mostly, but not entirely, the same things); the 
     last three are described separately: 

<screen> 
  %s  Add source 
  %e  Add event  
  %o  Add other 
</screen> 
  
<screen> 
  $s  List sources 
  $n  List notes 
  $$  List references 
</screen> 

</para> 



<para> 

     The handling of source, event and user-defined records in 
     <application>LifeLines</application> is still in 
     development. For example, sources cannot yet be searched by 
     REFN or be deleted.

     <action>Add a source record to the

<para> 

     This operation (or alternatively <keycap>%s</keycap> from the 
     person, family or auxiliary browse screens) is used to add a 
     new source record to the database. 
     <application>LifeLines</application> creates a template source 
     and puts you in the screen editor to edit the template. The 
     default template is: 

<programlisting> 

  0 SOUR 
  1 REFN 
  1 TITL <replaceable>Title</replaceable> 
  1 AUTH <replaceable>Author</replaceable> 

</programlisting> 

</para> 



<para> 

     Do not change the <structfield>0 SOUR</structfield> 
     line. Otherwise you may edit this record any way you like. The 
     <structfield>1 REFN</structfield> line is a special line you 
     can use to give the source a symbolic name that can be used in 
     other records to refer to the source record. See the section 
     on using <structfield>REFN</structfield> values. Because many 
     sources have a title and an author, the default template has 
     these lines. You may adjust the source template via the 
     SOURREC user option (either at the database level, via the 
     user options, or globally, via the configuration file). Here 
     is how I recorded one of the sources in my database: 

<example> 

<title> 
Example of a source record 
</title> 

<programlisting> 

  0 SOUR 
  1 REFN <userinput>jcw</userinput>

    2 ADDR <userinput>78 State Street</userinput></programlisting></example> 

</para> 

<para> 

     The add source command in the x menu is equivalent to the 
     <keycap>%s</keycap> command available in the person or family 
     browse screen, in terms of entering the source record; after 
     saving the source record though, there is one significant 
     difference, in that that you then are presented with the 
     following prompt (also, the key value of the new record is 
     displayed in the status bar at this point): 
</para> 

<screen> 
Please choose from the following options: 
  1: Insert xref automatically at bottom of current record. 
  2: Edit current record now to add xref manually. 
  3: Browse new record (without adding xref). 
  4: Return to current record (without adding xref). 

 Commands:   j Move down     k Move up    i Select     q Quit  
</screen> 

     <para> 

     The four options perform the following actions: 

     </para> 

     <para> 

     1: LifeLines adds a reference to the new source record at the 
     bottom of the person or family record that was visible in the 
     display screen when you prompted LifeLines to create the new 
     source record. 

     </para> 

     <para> 

     2: LifeLines will open the person or family record that was 
     visible in the display screen when you prompted LifeLines to 
     create the new source record, so that you can manually enter a 
     reference to the newly created source record (perhaps as a 
     source reference to an event that you are planning to add). 

     </para> 

     <para> 

     3: LifeLines lets you browse (and optionally reopen for 
     editing) your newly added source record. 

     </para> 

     <para>

This operation (or alternatively <keycap>%e</keycap> from the person, 
family or auxiliary browse screens) adds a new event record to the 
database.  <application>LifeLines</application> creates a template 
event and puts you in the screen editor to edit the template. The 
default template is:<programlisting> 

0 EVEN 
  1 REFN 
  1 DATE 
  1 PLAC 
  1 INDI 
    2 NAME 
    2 ROLE 
  1 SOUR</programlisting> 

</para> 

<para> 

     You may adjust the event template via the EVENREC user option (either 
     at the database level, via the user options, or globally, via the  
     configuration file). 

</para> 

<para> 

     Do not change the <structfield>0 EVEN</structfield> 
     line. Otherwise you may edit this record any way you like. The 
     <structfield>1 REFN</structfield> line allows you to give this 
     event a symbolic name you can use when you want to refer to 
     this event from other records. See the section on using 
     <structfield>REFN</structfield> values. The default template 
     suggests that an event has a date, a place, and refers to 
     persons in roles with respect to the event. There is far less 
     experience with event-based <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym> than 
     there is with simple person and family 
     <acronym>GEDCOM</acronym>. You may even be wondering why you 
     would need event records when you can simply tuck events away 
     in person and family records. This is a topic that may get 
     covered in an appendix.

<title> 
FAMILY STRUCTURE AND MERGING PERSONS AND FAMILIES 
</title> 

<para> 

     <application>LifeLines</application> 3.0.2 has relaxed most of 
     restrictions on family structure that were imposed by earlier 
     versions. For example, a family record may have more than one 
     parent/spouse of the same sex; a person may be a child in more 
     than family. This is a controversial issue. Some users insist 
     that family relationships should imply biological relatedness, 
     and that all other relationships should be handled by 
     different means. Others insist that non-traditional families 
     (any number of parents/spouses of any sex) should be allowed, 
     and that children can be members of more than one family (eg, 
     natural family and adoptive 
     family). <application>LifeLines</application> no longer takes 
     a position on this matter; you are free to set up families any 
     way you like; the operations that add spouses and children to 
     families no longer check for non-traditional arrangements. It 
     is possible that a future release will include a user option 
     to either disallow or to ask for confirmation about 
     non-traditional relationships. 

</para> 



<para> 

     <application>LifeLines</application> provides features for 
     merging persons together and for merging families 
     together. The person merging feature is accessed from the 
     tandem person browse mode, and the family merging feature is 
     accessed from the tandem family browse mode. You browse to the 
     two persons or families you want to merge and then use the j 
     command. Merging is necessary when you discover that two or 
     more person records, or two or more family records, represent 
     the same person or family, respectively. 

</para> 



<para> 

     Versions of <application>LifeLines</application> prior to 
     3.0.2 required that persons and families meet certain criteria 
     before they could be merged. The criteria ensured that the 
     merged persons and families would still meet traditional 
     family structuring rules. With the relaxation of the 
     structuring rules, restrictions on merging have also been 
     removed. It is now possible to create non-traditional 
     relationships by merging traditional persons and/or 
     families. For example, if you merge two persons that happen to 
     be children in two different families, the merged person will 
     be a child in both families. If you want to maintain only 
     traditional relationships in your database you may have to 
     makes further to changes to relationships after you complete a 
     merge operation.

LINKING RECORDS TOGETHER AND USING THE REFN FEATURE 

</title> 



<para> 

     Records in a <application>LifeLines</application> database may 
     refer to other records via cross-reference links. The 
     lineage-linked references are maintained directly by 
     <application>LifeLines</application> through operations found 
     in the browsing mode menus.  These references are the links 
     from a person to families (<structfield>1 FAMC</structfield> 
     and <structfield>1 FAMS</structfield>), and the links from a 
     family to persons (<structfield>1 HUSB</structfield>, 
     <structfield>1 WIFE</structfield> and <structfield>1 
     CHIL</structfield>). Because 
     <application>LifeLines</application> maintains these links you 
     are not allowed to change these lines when you are editing 
     records. There are a couple of seeming exceptions to this 
     rule. For example, you may change the order of <structfield>1 
     CHIL</structfield> lines in a family record in order to change 
     the order of children in a family, and you may change the 
     order of <structfield>1 FAMS</structfield> lines in a person 
     record to change the order of families the person was a spouse 
     or parent in. These operations are allowed because they don't 
     affect which person records refer to which family records and 
     vice versa. 

</para> 



<para> 

     Besides the lineage-links that are maintained by 
     <application>LifeLines</application>, you may place your own 
     links in records.  Probably the most common example of this is 
     referring events within a person record to the record of the 
     information source for the event. For example: 


<example> 

<title> 
Example of referring events from a person record 
</title> 

<programlisting> 

0 @I23@ INDI 
  1 NAME <userinput>Thomas/Whitmore/</userinput> 
  1 BIRT 
    2 DATE <userinput>about 1615</userinput> 
    2 PLAC <userinput>England</userinput> 
    2 SOUR @S3@ 
... 
0 @S3@ SOUR 
  1 REFN <userinput>cat</userinput> 
  1 TITL <userinput>New England Marriages Prior to 1700</userinput> 
  1 AUTH <userinput>Clarence Almon Torrey</userinput> 
...</programlisting></example> 

</para> 



<para> 

The <structfield>2 SOUR</structfield> <replaceable>@S3@</replaceable> line in the person record refers to the source record. <application>LifeLines</application> allows any specific 
structure within a record (in this case a birth event) to refer to another record. It is not possible to refer 
to a specific location within another record, though this may be supported eventually. 


</para> 



<para> 

This example implies that when linking one record to another you must know the key of the target 
record (S3 in the example). This is not desirable because internal record keys may change when the 
records are exported from one database or imported to another. 

</para> 



<para> 

     Because internal key values are not permanent, 
     <application>LifeLines</application> allows you to assign a 
     permanent user-defined key to any record in the database using 
     the <structfield>1 REFN</structfield> line. The value of this 
     line is a string that you choose as your permanent key value 
     for the record. When adding a link to a record that has a user 
     <structfield>REFN</structfield> key value, you may use that 
     value instead of the internal key value. For example, when 
     adding the person in the previous example you could edit the 
     new record as follows: 

<example> 

<title> 
Example of adding a new person 
</title> 

<programlisting> 

  0 INDI 
  1 NAME <userinput>Thomas/Whitmore/</userinput> 
  1 BIRT 
    2 DATE <userinput>about 1615</userinput> 
    2 PLAC <userinput>England</userinput> 
    2 SOUR <userinput>&lt;cat&gt;</userinput></programlisting></example> 

</para> 



<para> 

     Instead of using the actual key value of the source, S3, the 
     <structfield>REFN</structfield> value cat was used. The 
     <structfield>REFN</structfield> value must be enclosed by 
     angle brackets when used this 
     way. <application>LifeLines</application> automatically 
     replaces the <structfield>REFN</structfield> link with the 
     proper internal key value when the record is stored in the 
     database. 


</para> 



<para> 

     The <structfield>REFN</structfield> value may also be used 
     when searching for person, source, event and user-defined 
     records.  You should not add more than one 
     <structfield>REFN</structfield> line to a record, and every 
     <structfield>REFN</structfield> value should be unique.
