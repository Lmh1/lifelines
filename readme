LifeLines Source Release, Version 3.0.4, 15 December 1999

This is the source distribution of the LifeLines system, a genealogy
software system.  Execute either:

	sh build SYSV
or
	sh build BSD

depending on your UNIX version (SYSV for AT&T, BSD for Berkeley).  You will
end up with two executables in the ./bin subdirectory:

lines302  -- main LifeLines system program
btedit302 -- general purpose btree edit program

Don't use btedit unless you know exactly what it does.  It is a superuser
administration tool for unmangling mangled databases -- powerful, but
deadly.  It is rarely, if ever, needed.

I am the author of all LifeLines code, and hereby release it under the
MIT-style license located in the file LICENSE provided with this
source kit.

There is a reference guide in ./docs/quickref.ps.Z.uu.  Run uudecode and
uncompress on that file to retrieve the postscript file of the manual.
