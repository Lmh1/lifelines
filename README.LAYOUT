LifeLines Source Release, Version 3.0.6
http://lifelines.sourceforge.net
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a brief description of the directory layout.

Source Code Directories
-----------------------

./hdrs/

    Header files.
    screen.h is curses-specific, and will probably be moved eventually.

./hdrs/win32/

    Headers for win32 implementation code.

./arch/

    Library of replacement functions missing on some platforms.

./btree/

    btree (database) implementation, with access functions.
    Used by the rest of lifelines to access the binary database.

./gedlib/

    Implementation of the INDISEQ type.
    Implementation of NAME & REFN records.
    Node functions (extracting from & sending to db, and some top-level
     node conversions, eg indi_to_event).
    messages (attempt to put together all strings for hopeful localization).
    miscellaneous other stuff (including initialization code).

./interp/

    Report generator program interpreter.

./stdlib/

    Common data types & functions used by other LifeLines modules,
    including:
      lists (in double.c), tables, sequences, string stuff
    These are all independent of LifeLines or GEDCOM, except that
    that lloptions is in here, perhaps temporarily.

./liflines/

    The frontend logic and GUI code of the LifeLines application.
    Code to implement import & export, editing, & merging records.
    The curses interface is somewhat but not entirely separated 
    from the application.
    Curses specific:
      screen.c, show.c
    Not curses, but tied to the idea of a console interface, and
    probably will not be used by other interfaces:
      menuitem.c, pedigree.c

./tools/

    btedit - edit the binary records in the btree (database) itself
    dbverify - check a database for errors

./ui/ (UNDER DEVELOPMENT)

    Will contain UI-specific code for obtaining input and displaying
    output

./win32/ (ALMOST OBSOLETE)

    Code from the win32 port, used only when creating win32 target

./win32/hdrs/ (OBSOLETE)

    Headers used in win32 port (before ./hdrs existed)


Non-Source Code Directories
---------------------------

./docs/

    Versions of the quick reference guide

./reports/

    Lifelines language reports (*.ll)
