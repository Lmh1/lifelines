lifelines/win32/hdrs
is obsolete

These headers were used by the win32 version when
the main directories were missing MANY function
declarations.

In late 2000 declarations were added to the main
version, obsoleting this directory.

Win32 specific headers are at this moment located
in lifelines/hdrs/win32.
