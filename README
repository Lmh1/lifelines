LifeLines Source Release, Version 3.0.5-2, 22 July 2000

This is the source distribution of the LifeLines system, a genealogy
software system.  To build and install, execute these commands:

	./configure
	make
        make install

which will generate Makefiles suitable for your platform and then build
and installthe LifeLines programs.  You will end up with two 
executables (installed in various places, depending on your platform):

llines  -- main LifeLines system program
btedit -- general purpose btree edit program

Don't use btedit unless you know exactly what it does.  It is a superuser
administration tool for unmangling mangled databases -- powerful, but
deadly.  It is rarely, if ever, needed.

The original author of LifeLines is Thomas T. Wetmore IV, who released
it to the open source community under a MIT-style licence (see LICENCE).

LifeLines is now maintained by the open source community.  Please visit
